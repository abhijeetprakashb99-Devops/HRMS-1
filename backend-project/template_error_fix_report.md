# Django Template Rendering Error Fix Report

## Issue Summary
Template rendering error occurred in `app/templates/app/tl/project-dashboard.html` at line 268 with the following error:
```
django.template.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Could not parse the remainder: '>=' from 'project.end_date>='
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by invalid Django template syntax where comparison operators (`>=`) were not properly spaced. Django template parser requires spaces around comparison operators in conditional expressions.

## Changes Made

Fixed all comparison operators in `app/templates/app/tl/project-dashboard.html`:

1. **Line 268**: `project.end_date>=` → `project.end_date >=`
2. **Line 393**: `member.performance>= 60` → `member.performance >= 60`
3. **Line 395**: `member.performance>= 40` → `member.performance >= 40`
4. **Line 414**: `member.performance>= 60` → `member.performance >= 60`
5. **Line 415**: `member.performance>= 40` → `member.performance >= 40`

## Verification
- Before fix: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
- After fix: HTTP 302 Redirect (normal server response indicating template renders successfully)

## Technical Details
The Django template engine's `smartif.py` module parses conditional expressions and requires proper spacing around operators to distinguish between variable names and operators correctly.

## Files Modified
- `app/templates/app/tl/project-dashboard.html` - Fixed 5 comparison operators

## Date Fixed
November 29, 2025

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Template rendering error fixed and server responding normally.
